- **Transparent**: Enforce natural alignment without any changes to how your
  objects are used.
- **Efficient**: Prevent your compiler from emitting libcalls to builtin
  atomic functions and ensure it uses native atomic instructions instead.

.. code-block:: c++

   #include "pw_alignment/alignment.h"

   // Passing a `std::optional<bool>` to `__atomic_exchange` might not replace
   // the call with native instructions if the compiler cannot determine all
   // instances of this object will happen to be aligned.
   std::atomic<std::optional<bool>> maybe_nat_aligned_obj;

   // `pw::NaturallyAligned<...>` forces the object to be aligned to its size,
   // so passing it to `__atomic_exchange` will result in a replacement with
   // native instructions.
   std::atomic<pw::NaturallyAligned<std::optional<bool>>> nat_aligned_obj;

   // Shorter spelling for the same as above.
   pw::AlignedAtomic<std::optional<bool>> also_nat_aligned_obj;

``pw_alignment`` portably ensures that your compiler uses native atomic
instructions rather than libcalls to builtin atomic functions. Take for example
``std::atomic<std::optional<bool>>``. Accessing the underlying object normally
involves a call to a builtin ``__atomic_*`` function. The problem is that the
compiler sometimes can't determine that the size of the object is the same
as the size of its alignment. ``pw_alignment`` ensures that an object aligns to
its size so that compilers can always make this optimization.

.. warning::
   Using ``std::optional<bool>`` is only a workaround that may not work with all
   compilers. This specifically does not work when targetting ARM cortex M0.
   Additionally, ``std::optional<bool>`` is not the recommended way to represent
   a ternary variable.

         }

   .. tab-item:: GN

      Add ``$dir_pw_alignment`` to the ``deps`` list in your ``pw_executable()``
      build target:

      .. code-block::
