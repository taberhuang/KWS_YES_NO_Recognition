.. pigweed-module::
   :name: pw_package

The package module provides a mechanism to install additional resources used by
Pigweed.

Pigweed does not (with a few very specific and small exceptions) include mirrors
or submodules containing external source dependencies like FreeRTOS, STM32Cube,
Raspberry Pi Pico SDK, etc. This is done to ensure projects can vendor the
version of their choice, and reduces the proliferation of multiple definitions
of these dependencies.

While part of this module is supported for downstream use, the general answer of
whether you should use this module in your project is "no".

.. admonition:: Warning
   :class: error

   This module is only intended to be used by Pigweed. Please do not rely on it.

-----
Usage
-----
The package module can be accessed through the ``pw package`` command. This
has several subcommands.

``pw package list``
  Lists all the packages installed followed by all the packages available.

``pw package install <package-name>``
  Installs ``<package-name>``. Exactly how this works is package-dependent,
  and packages can decide to do nothing because the package is current, do an
  incremental update, or delete the current version and install anew. Use
  ``--force`` to remove the package before installing.

``pw package status <package-name>``
  Indicates whether ``<package-name>`` is installed.

``pw package remove <package-name>``
  Removes ``<package-name>``.

By default ``pw package`` operates on the directory referenced by
``PW_PACKAGE_ROOT``.

Middleware-Only Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pigweed itself includes a number of packages that simply clone git repositories.
In general, these should not be used by projects using Pigweed. Projects
should use `Git submodules
<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`__ instead of packages.
To bypass this restriction and install these packages anyway,
use ``--force`` on the command line or ``force=True`` in Python code.

Python 3

Adding a New Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To add a new package create a class that subclasses ``Package`` from
``pw_package/package_manager.py``.

.. code-block:: python

   class Package:
       """Package to be installed.

       Subclass this to implement installation of a specific package.
       """
       def __init__(self, name):
           self._name = name

       @property
       def name(self):
           return self._name

       def install(self, path: pathlib.Path) -> None:
           """Install the package at path.

           Install the package in path. Cannot assume this directory is emptyâ€”it
           may need to be deleted or updated.
           """

       def remove(self, path: pathlib.Path) -> None:
           """Remove the package from path.

           Removes the directory containing the package. For most packages this
           should be sufficient to remove the package, and subclasses should not
           need to override this package.
           """
           if os.path.exists(path):
               shutil.rmtree(path)

       def status(self, path: pathlib.Path) -> bool:
           """Returns if package is installed at path and current.

           This method will be skipped if the directory does not exist.
           """

There's also a helper class for retrieving specific revisions of Git
repositories in ``pw_package/git_repo.py``.

Then call ``pw_package.package_manager.register(PackageClass)`` to register
the class with the package manager.

Setting up a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To set up the package manager for a new project create a file like below and
add it to the ``PW_PLUGINS`` file (see :ref:`module-pw_cli` for details). This
file is based off of ``pw_package/pigweed_packages.py``.

.. code-block:: python

   from pw_package import package_manager
   # These modules register themselves so must be imported despite appearing
   # unused.
   from pw_package.packages import nanopb

   def main(argv=None) -> int:
       return package_manager.run(**vars(package_manager.parse_args(argv)))

Options
~~~~~~~
Options for code formatting can be specified in the ``pigweed.json`` file
(see also :ref:`SEED-0101 <seed-0101>`). This is currently limited to one
option.

* ``allow_middleware_only_packages``: Allow middleware-only packages to be
  installed. See :ref:`module-pw_package-middleware-only-packages` for more.

.. code-block::

   {
     "pw": {
       "pw_package": {
         "allow_middleware_only_packages": true
       }
     }
   }
