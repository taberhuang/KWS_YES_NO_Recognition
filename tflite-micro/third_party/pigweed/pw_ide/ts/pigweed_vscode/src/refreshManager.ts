/**
 * A device for managing "refreshes" of IDE support data.
 *
 * Certain IDE support data needs to be refreshed periodically or in response
 * user actions (for example, generating compile commands, building codegen
 * files, etc.). The `RefreshManager` provides a mechanism to do those refreshes
 * in a structured way and provide hooks that UI elements can use to surface
 * status to the user.
 *
 * The `RefreshManager` itself doesn't actually do anything except watch out for
 * a refresh signal (set by calling `refresh()`), then run through each of its
 * defined states, calling registered callbacks at each state. So it's up to the
 * caller to register callbacks that do the real work.
 *
 * As an example, if you have a function `refreshCompileCommands`, you can
 * register it to run during the `refreshing` state:
 *
 * `refreshManager.on(refreshCompileCommands, 'refreshing');`
 *
 * Now, when `refreshManager.refresh()` is called, the function will be called
 * when the process enters the `refreshing` stage. You can surface the status
 * in a UI element by registering callbacks to change a status line or icon
 * in stages like `idle`, `willRefresh`, and `fault`.
 *
 * The abort signal can be set at any time via `abort()` to cancel an
 * in-progress refresh process.

   * example, if the current `State` is `'didRefresh'`, `NextState<State>` is
   * `'idle' | 'fault'`. But only one of those two can be provided, and we
   * don't want the return type to be `RefreshManager<'idle' | 'fault'>`. So
   * `SpecificNextState` ensures that the return type is narrowed down.
   *
   * Explicitly adding `'fault'` and `'abort'` to the variants for
   * `SpecificNextState` is just to reassure and convince the compiler that
   * those states can be transitioned to from any other state. This is clear
   * from the definition of `NextState`, but without it, the compiler concludes
   * that it can't conclude anything about what states can be transitioned to
   * from an unknown state.
   *
   * The fact that this method returns itself is just a type system convenience
   * that lets us do state machine accounting. There's still always just one
   * refresh manager behind the curtain.
   *
   * Something to keep in mind is that the type of the return represents the
   * "happy path". If the path was actually unhappy, the return will be in the
   * fault state, but we don't know about that at the type system level. But
   * you don't need to worry about that; just handle things as if they worked
   * out, and if they didn't, the next states will just execute an early return.
