    This will replace your current Visual Studio Code (VSC) settings for this
    project (in ``.vscode/settings.json``, etc.) with the following sets of
    settings, in order:

    - The Pigweed default settings
    - Your project's settings, if any (in ``.vscode/pw_project_settings.json``)
    - Your personal settings, if any (in ``.vscode/pw_user_settings.json``)

    In other words, settings files lower on the list can override settings
    defined by those higher on the list. Settings defined in the sources above
    are not active in VSC until they are merged and output to the current
    settings file by running:

    .. code-block:: bash

       pw ide vscode

    Refer to the Visual Studio Code documentation for more information about
    these settings: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings

    This command also manages VSC tasks (``.vscode/tasks.json``) and extensions
    (``.vscode/extensions.json``). You can explicitly control which of these
    settings types ("settings", "tasks", and "extensions") is modified by
    this command by using the ``--include`` or ``--exclude`` options.

    Your current VSC settings will never change unless you run ``pw ide``
    commands. Since the current VSC settings are an artifact built from the
    three settings files described above, you should avoid manually editing
    that file; it will be replaced the next time you run ``pw ide vscode``. A
    backup of your previous settings file will be made, and you can diff it
    against the new file to see what changed.

    These commands will never modify your VSC user settings, which are
    stored outside of the project repository and apply globally to all VSC
    instances.

    The settings files are system-specific and shouldn't be checked into the
    repository, except for the project settings (those with ``pw_project_``),
    which can be used to define consistent settings for everyone working on the
    project.

    Note that support for VSC can be disabled at the project level or the user
    level by adding the following to .pw_ide.yaml or .pw_ide.user.yaml
    respectively:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        editors:

    """Configure C/C++ code intelligence support.

    Code intelligence can be provided by clangd or other language servers that
    use the clangd compilation database format, defined at:
    https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html

    Pigweed projects define their build configuration(s) via a build system,
    usually GN, Bazel, or CMake. Based on build configurations, the build
    system generates commands to compile each translation unit in the project.
    clangd uses those commands to parse the build graph and provide rich code
    intelligence.

    Pigweed projects often target multiple devices & architectures, and use
    multiple compiler toolchains. As a result, there may be more than one way
    to compile each translation unit. Your build system ensures that it only
    invokes a single compiler command for each translation unit which is
    consistent with the toolchain and target appropriate to that build, which
    we refer to as a "target toolchain".

    We need to do the same thing with the compilation database that clangd uses.
    We handle this by:

    - Processing the compilation database produced the build system into
      multiple internally-consistent compilation databases, one for each
      target toolchain.

    - Providing commands to select which target toolchain you want to use for
      code analysis.

    Refer to the Pigweed documentation or your build system's documentation to
    learn how to produce a clangd compilation database. Once you have one, run
    this command to process it:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pw ide cpp --process-files {path to compile_commands.json}

    When using GN and CMake, ``pw_ide`` can search your build directory (or
    other directories specified in settings) for compilation databases with:

    .. code-block:: bash

       pw ide cpp --process

    You can now examine the target toolchains that are available to you:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pw ide cpp --list

    ... and select the target toolchain you want to use:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pw ide cpp --set host_clang

    As long as your editor or language server plugin is properly configured, you
    will now get code intelligence features relevant to that particular target
    toolchain.

    You can see what target toolchain is selected by running:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pw ide cpp

    Whenever you switch to a target toolchain you haven't used before, clangd
    will index the build, which may take several minutes. This process is not
    blocking, so you can take advantage of code analysis immediately even while
    the indexing is in progress. These indexes are cached, so you can switch
    between targets without re-indexing each time.

    If your build configuration changes significantly (e.g. you add a new file
    to the project), you will need to re-process the compilation database for
    that change to be recognized and manifested in the target toolchain. Your
    target toolchain selection will not change, and your index will only need to
    be incrementally updated.

    You can generate the clangd command your editor needs to run with:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pw ide cpp --clangd-command

    If your editor uses JSON for configuration, you can export the same command
    in that format:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pw ide cpp --clangd-command-for json
