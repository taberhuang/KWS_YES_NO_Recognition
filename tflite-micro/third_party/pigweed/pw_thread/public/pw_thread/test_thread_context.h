///
/// To create a thread for unit testing, instantiate a `TestThreadContext`, then
/// call `options()` to obtain a `pw::thread::Options`. Use that `Options` to
/// start a `Thread`. Users must ensure the context's lifespan outlives the
/// thread it creates. Recycling or destroying the context is only allowed if
/// `join()` is called on the thread first.

/// Threads created with `TestThreadContext` cannot be configured in any way.
/// Backends should create threads with sufficient resources to execute typical

/// Non-portable tests may include backend-specific headers and instantiate
/// thread options for their platforms as required.

/// @note Developers should structure their logic so it can be tested without
/// spawning a thread. Unit tests should avoid spawning threads unless

/// @warning Threads using the `TestThreadContext` may only be detached if the
