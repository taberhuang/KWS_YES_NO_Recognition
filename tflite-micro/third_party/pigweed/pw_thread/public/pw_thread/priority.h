/// default policy for real-time operating systems is preemptive scheduling,
/// where the highest priority ready thread is always selected to run. If there
/// are multiple tasks with the same priority, RTOSes may use round-robin
/// scheduling, where each ready thread at a given priority is given equal
/// opportunity to run.
///
/// Priorities may be compared with `==`, `!=`, `<`, etc. Comparisons occur in
/// terms of the native priorities they represent, but are translated such that
/// logically lower priorities always compare as less than higher priorities,
/// even if the underlying RTOS uses lower numbers for higher priorities.
