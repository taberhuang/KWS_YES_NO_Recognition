/// An abstract interface representing a Clock.
///
/// This interface allows decoupling code that uses time from the code that
/// creates a point in time. You can use this to your advantage by injecting
/// Clocks into interfaces rather than having implementations call
/// `SystemClock::now()` directly. However, this comes at a cost of a vtable per
/// implementation and more importantly passing and maintaining references to
/// the VirtualClock for all of the users.
///
/// This interface is thread and IRQ safe.
