#ifndef PW_MULTIBUF_VERSION
/// Sets the version of MultiBuf provided by this module.
///
/// This module is undergoing refactoring to improve usability and
/// performance. Some portions of the version 1 API are in use by downstream
/// consumers. These legacy interfaces are preserved for now, but deprecated.
///
/// Both versions are intended to minimize copying when working with sequences
/// of memory buffers. These buffers are typically used to hold datagrams for
/// use with I/O, and may be discontiguous.
///
/// Notable differences between the two versions include:
/// * V1 required the use of a MultiBufAllocator, whereas V2 defers memory
///   allocation strategies to the consumer.
/// * V1 could provide views of higher level protocols be releasing and claiming
///   prefixes and suffixes. V2 instead describes "layers" of span-like views of
///   the underlying data.
///
/// Versions higher than 2 are currently unsupported.
///
/// Initially, this setting defaults to 1. Eventually, this will default to 2.
/// Downstream projects may still use version 1 by overriding this
/// configuration, but must be aware that version 1 will eventually be removed.
