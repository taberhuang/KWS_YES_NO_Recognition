/// For example, in a TCP/IP stack:
///  * The first entry hold addresses to Ethernet frames.
///  * The second entry holds a zero offset and the whole frame length.
///  * The third entry holds the offset and length describing the IP data.
///  * The fourth entry holds the offset and length describing the TCP data.
