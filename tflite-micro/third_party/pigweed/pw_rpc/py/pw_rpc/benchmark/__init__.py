"""Pigweed RPC Benchmark tools.

The ``benchmark`` folder contains a few utilities:

#. A host-side client, ``benchmark.py``, containing functions for basic RPC
   statistics gathering and measurement.
#. An output definition file, ``benchmark_results.py``, used to record tests
   results and enable extending test data.

The host-side client is intended to be included in a user's custom project,
while the default runner, implemented in ``pw_system``, can be invoked as a
python module in a terminal.

The default runner has been implemented in the ``pw_system`` module.  It can
be used as a metric of its own or as a starting implementation for users to
make their own benchmarking runner.

See the ``pw_system`` folder for details on the default runner.
