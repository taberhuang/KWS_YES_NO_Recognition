///
/// **Queue sizing**: The number of outstanding work requests is limited
/// based on the internal queue size. The queue size is set through either
/// the size of the `queue_storage` buffer passed into the constructor or by
/// using the templated `pw::work_queue::WorkQueueWithBuffer` helper. When the
/// queue is full, the queue will not accept further work.
///
/// **Cooperative thread cancellation**: The class is a
/// `pw::thread::ThreadCore`, meaning it should be executed as a single thread.
/// To facilitate clean shutdown, it provides a `RequestStop()` method for
/// cooperative cancellation which should be invoked before joining the thread.
/// Once a stop has been requested the queue will no longer accept further work.
///
/// The entire API is thread-safe and interrupt-safe.
