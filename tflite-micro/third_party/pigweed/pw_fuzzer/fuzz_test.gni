# Creates a unit test that may also include fuzzing test cases.
#
# This template merely updates test metadata and adds a dependency on FuzzTest
# before forwarding to `pw_test`. The resulting test can always be run as a unit
# test. If `dir_pw_third_party_fuzztest` is set and the toolchain used to build
# the test supports fuzzing, it can also be run as a fuzzer.
#
# As with `pw_test`, targets defined using this template will produce test
# metadata with a `test_type` of "unit_test" and an additional `test_directory`
# value describing the location of the test binary within the build output.
# These tests can be distinguished from other unit tests by additionally having
# a "fuzztest" tag.
#
# Args:
#   - All of the `pw_test` args are accepted.
