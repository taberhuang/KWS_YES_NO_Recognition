 * The INSERT directive instructs the linker to merge the directives in this
 * script with the default linker script, rather than replace the default with
 * this script. The tokenized sections need to appear in the merged script
 * before the .rodata section, to ensure that all of the correct symbols end up
 * in the tokenized section. Here we insert them just after the .debug_info
 * section, which both clang and GCC use.
