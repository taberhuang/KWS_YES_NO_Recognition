/// `Dispatcher`s run many short, non-blocking units of work on a single thread.
/// This approach has a number of advantages compared with executing concurrent
/// tasks on separate threads:
///
/// - `Dispatcher`s can make more efficient use of system resources, since they
///   don't need to maintain separate thread stacks.
/// - `Dispatcher`s can run on systems without thread support, such as no-RTOS
///   embedded environments.
/// - `Dispatcher`s allow tasks to communicate with one another without the
///   synchronization overhead of locks, atomics, fences, or `volatile`.
///
/// Thread support: `Dispatcher` methods may be safely invoked from any thread,
/// but the resulting tasks will always execute on a single thread. Whether
/// or not methods may be invoked from interrupt context is
/// implementation-defined.
///
/// `VirtualSystemClock`: `Dispatcher` implements `VirtualSystemClock` in order
/// to provide a consistent source of (possibly mocked) time information to
/// tasks.
///
/// A simple default dispatcher implementation is provided by `pw_async_basic`.
