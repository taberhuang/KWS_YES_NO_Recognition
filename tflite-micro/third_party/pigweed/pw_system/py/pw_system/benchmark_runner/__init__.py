"""Pigweed System RPC Benchmark runner.

The ``benchmark_runner`` folder is a convenience tool to execute RPC benchmarks
using the benchmarking tools found in ``pw_rpc``.  It contains:

#. A host-side runner, ``benchmark_runner.py``, providing a default set of RPC
   Benchmark test cases to execute.

``pw_rpc``'s host-side client is intended to be included in a user's custom
project, while the default runner can be invoked as a python module in a
terminal.

To execute the host-side runner, open two (2) terminals:

#. In both terminals:

   #. Navigate to your root-level project folder.
   #. ``source activate.sh``

#. In terminal A:

   #. ``bazel run //pw_system:simulator_system_example``

#. In terminal B:

   #. ``python -m pw_system.benchmark_runner -s default --cli``

# The generated protos for this module overlap this `__init__.py` file's import
# namespace, so we need to use extend_path() for them to be discoverable.
# Note: this needs to be done in every nested `__init__.py` file as well (if
# any exist).
