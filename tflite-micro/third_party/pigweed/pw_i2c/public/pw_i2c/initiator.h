/// @brief The common, base driver interface for initiating thread-safe
/// transactions with devices on an I2C bus. Other documentation may call this
/// style of interface an I2C "master", <!-- inclusive-language: disable -->
/// "central", or "controller".
///
/// `pw::i2c::Initiator` isn't required to support 10-bit addressing. If only
/// 7-bit addressing is supported, `pw::i2c::Initiator` fails a runtime
/// assertion if given a Message with the kTenBitAddress flag, or when given
/// an address that is out of 7-bit address range.
///
/// The implementer of TransferFor() (or DoWriteReadFor()) is responsible for
/// ensuring thread safety and enabling functionality such as initialization,
/// configuration, enabling and disabling, unsticking SDA, and detecting device
/// address registration collisions.
///
/// @note `pw::i2c::Initiator` uses internal synchronization, so it's safe to
/// initiate transactions from multiple threads. Each call to this class will
/// be executed in a single bus transaction using repeated starts.
///
/// Furthermore, devices may require specific sequences of
/// transactions, and application logic must provide the synchronization to
/// execute these sequences correctly.
