      Uses the pw_minimal_cpp_stdlib C++ standard library implementation.
      The build must set `-nostdinc++` to exclude the toolchain's standard
      library. This is NOT a full standard library implementation and may
      only be used to build pw_tokenizer.
      see :ref:'module-pw_minimal_cpp_stdlib' for module details.
