# Inspect Test Matchers
InspectTesting is an extension to the gmock library to support matching against
Inspect output. This library was originally copied from
[Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/main/sdk/lib/inspect/testing/)
and any modifications should ideally be made there first and copied back to
Pigweed.
