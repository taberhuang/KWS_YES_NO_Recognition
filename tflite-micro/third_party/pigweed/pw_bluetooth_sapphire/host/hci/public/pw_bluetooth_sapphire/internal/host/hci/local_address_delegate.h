  //  * |address_type| is public (i.e. public type was explicitly requested by
  //    a privileged client)
  //  * privacy is not enabled and |address_type| is unspecified (i.e. nullopt)
  // Note that requesting a random address while privacy is not enabled is not
  // allowed. If none of the above is true, then it can only mean that privacy
  // is enabled and:
  //  * |address_type| is random (i.e. random type was explicitly requested by
  //    any client)
  //  * |address_type| was unspecified (in which case, we still want to
  //    advertise a random type)
