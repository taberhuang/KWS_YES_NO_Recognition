  // PDU if |fragment| completes a sequence or constitutes a complete fragment
  // on its own. The |frames_dropped| flag is set to true if a sequence was
  // dropped due to a recombination error. The most likely causes for an error
  // are:
  //
  //   1. |fragment| contains a malformed L2CAP frame. A packet is treated as
  //   malformed if:
  //      a. Its suspected to be the first fragment in a new recombination
  //      sequence and does not contain a complete L2CAP basic header. b. After
  //      a recombination sequence is considered complete, the length of the
  //      frame does not match the length that was obtained from the L2CAP basic
  //      header.
  //
  //   2. |fragment| begins a new sequence when a prior incomplete sequence was
  //   in progress, in which case the incomplete sequence is dropped but
  //   |fragment| is retained UNLESS |fragment| itself constitues a malformed
  //   PDU (as in #1);
  //
  //   3. |fragment| is a continuing fragment that leaves the sequence in
  //   progress in a malformed state, in which case the sequence and |fragment|
  //   are dropped;
  //
  // A "true" |frames_dropped| value does not imply that the supplied input
  // |fragment| itself was in error and it is possible for |frames_dropped| to
  // be true alongside a valid |pdu| value. The caller can resume calling
  // ConsumeFragment as normal, as the Recombiner can internally recover from a
  // recombination error.
  //
  // This function panics if |fragment| is not built for the connection handle
  // that this Recombiner was assigned to.
