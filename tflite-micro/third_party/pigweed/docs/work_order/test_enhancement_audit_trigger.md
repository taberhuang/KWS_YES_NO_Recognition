# Work Order: Test Enhancement Audit: trigger conditions

This work order provides a structured process for auditing and improving the
test coverage for a specific area of functionality within a Pigweed module.

## When to use

- When a user wants to improve test coverage for a specific feature.
- When a user mentions that a piece of code seems under-tested or lacks tests
  for edge cases.
- When a bug is found that should have been caught by existing tests.
- When preparing a module for a new release and wanting to harden its
  reliability.
- When a user explicitly asks to audit or improve tests for a module.
