# Work Order: Compile Docs Examples: trigger conditions

This work order converts inline documentation code examples into standalone,
buildable, and testable files, following Pigweed's test-driven documentation
philosophy. This ensures examples are correct and won't break over time.

## When to use

- When there is a need to ensure documentation code examples are correct and
  buildable.
- When a module's documentation is being updated.
- When preparing for a release and ensuring all documentation is up to date.
- When the user directly requests this work order.
