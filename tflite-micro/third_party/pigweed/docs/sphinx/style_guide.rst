   Pigweed runs ``pw format`` as part of ``pw presubmit`` to perform some code
   formatting checks. To speed up the review process, consider adding ``pw
   presubmit`` as a git push hook using the following command:
   ``pw presubmit --install``

Documentation style guides

See the :ref:`documentation contributors homepage <docs-contrib-docs>`.

.. _docs-pw-todo-style:

----------
TODO style
----------
Pigweed expects TODO annotations to adhere to the following style:

.. todo-check: disable

.. code-block:: py

   # TODO: https://pwbug.dev/123456789 - Some explanation of the problem at
   # hand, which may span multiple lines if necessary.

.. todo-check: enable

.. admonition:: Note

   Please include the ``https://`` to make it easier for code editors to
   identify the bugs as URLs.

In Markdown docs like
`Rustdoc <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html>`_
the following format is preferred:

.. todo-check: disable

.. code-block:: rs

   //! TODO: <pwbug.dev/123456789> - Explanation.

.. todo-check: enable

.. admonition:: Note

   For Rustdoc, omit ``https://``. The additional Markdown syntax makes the
   link explicit, and including ``https://`` makes the preamble disruptively
   lengthy.

Some older forms are still allowed but discouraged. We allow the following
formats, ordered by preference with the preferred patterns at the top:

.. todo-check: disable

.. code-block:: py

   # TODO: https://pwbug.dev/1234 - Explanation.
   # TODO: b/1234 - Explanation.
   # TODO: username@ - Explanation.
   # TODO: username@example.com - Explanation.
   # TODO(b/1234): Explanation.
   # TODO(username): Explanation.

---------------
Build files: GN
---------------
Each Pigweed source module requires a GN build file named BUILD.gn. This
encapsulates the build targets and specifies their sources and dependencies.
GN build files use a format similar to `Bazel's BUILD files
<https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/build-ref.html>`_
(see the `Bazel style guide
<https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/skylark/build-style.html>`_).

C/C++ build targets include a list of fields. The primary fields are:

* ``<public>`` -- public header files
* ``<sources>`` -- source files and private header files
* ``<public_configs>`` -- public build configuration
* ``<configs>`` -- private build configuration
* ``<public_deps>`` -- public dependencies
* ``<deps>`` -- private dependencies

Assets within each field must be listed in alphabetical order.

.. code-block:: cpp

   # Here is a brief example of a GN build file.

   import("$dir_pw_unit_test/test.gni")

   config("public_include_path") {
     include_dirs = [ "public" ]
     visibility = [":*"]
   }

   pw_source_set("pw_sample_module") {
     public = [ "public/pw_sample_module/sample_module.h" ]
     sources = [
       "public/pw_sample_module/internal/secret_header.h",
       "sample_module.cc",
       "used_by_sample_module.cc",
     ]
     public_configs = [ ":public_include_path" ]
     public_deps = [ dir_pw_status ]
     deps = [ dir_pw_varint ]
   }

   pw_test_group("tests") {
     tests = [ ":sample_module_test" ]
   }

   pw_test("sample_module_test") {
     sources = [ "sample_module_test.cc" ]
     deps = [ ":sample_module" ]
   }

------------------
Build files: Bazel
------------------
Build files for the Bazel build system must be named ``BUILD.bazel``. Bazel can
interpret files named just ``BUILD``, but Pigweed uses ``BUILD.bazel`` to avoid
ambiguity with other build systems or tooling.

Pigweed's Bazel files follow the `Bazel style guide
<https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/skylark/build-style.html>`_.

------------------
Build files: Soong
------------------
Build files (blueprints) for the Soong build system must be named
``Android.bp``. The way Pigweed modules and backends are used is documented in
:ref:`module-pw_build_android`.

.. _owners-style:

--------------------
Code Owners (OWNERS)
--------------------
If you use Gerrit for source code hosting and have the
`code-owners <https://android-review.googlesource.com/plugins/code-owners/Documentation/backend-find-owners.html>`__
plug-in enabled Pigweed can help you enforce consistent styling on those files
and also detects some errors.

The styling follows these rules:

#. Content is grouped by type of line (Access grant, include, etc).
#. Each grouping is sorted alphabetically.
#. Groups are placed the following order with a blank line separating each
   grouping.

   * "set noparent" line
   * "include" lines
   * "file:" lines
   * user grants (some examples: "*", "foo@example.com")
   * "per-file:" lines

This plugin will, by default, act upon any file named "OWNERS".
