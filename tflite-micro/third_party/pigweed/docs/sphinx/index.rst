      :class-item: sales-pitch-cta-secondary

      Fork our minimal, Bazel-based starter project to create a new
      Pigweed project from scratch. The project includes a basic
      blinky LED program that runs on Raspberry Pi Picos and can
      be simulated on your development host.

.. TODO: b/358432838 - Update this section once the banned word list is fixed.

Pigweed has shipped in millions of devices, including Google's suite of Pixel
devices, Nest thermostats, `satellites`_, and `autonomous aerial drones`_.

--------------------
Showcase: pw_console
--------------------
:ref:`module-pw_console` is our multi-purpose, pluggable REPL and log viewer.
It's designed to be a complete development and manufacturing solution for
interacting with hardware devices via :ref:`module-pw_rpc` over a
:ref:`module-pw_hdlc` transport. Gone are the days of hacking together a REPL
and log viewer for each new project!
