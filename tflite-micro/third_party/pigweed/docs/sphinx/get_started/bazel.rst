==================================
Get Started With Pigweed And Bazel
==================================
We recently updated our Bazel quickstart repository and are in the process
of updating this tutorial. You can browse the new repository here (the
README has instructions on how to get started):
https://cs.opensource.google/pigweed/quickstart/bazel

In the meantime, you can also check out :ref:`showcase-sense` for a guided,
interactive tour of Pigweed's core features.
