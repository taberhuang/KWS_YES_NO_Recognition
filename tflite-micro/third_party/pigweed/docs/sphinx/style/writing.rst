``pigweed.dev``.

.. _docs-pw-style-writing-other:

1. Check if this writing style guide answers your style question.
2. If you don't find an answer in this guide, check the
   `Google developer documentation style guide`_ (GDDSG). If the GDDSG answers
   your question, use that answer.
3. If neither this guide nor the GDDSG answers your question, `create an issue`_
   in the Pigweed tracker. The answer will either get added to this guide or to
   the GDDSG.

.. note::

   The GDDSG is the "base class" of Pigweed's writing style. The writing style
   guide you're currently looking at is the "derived class" that can override
   the base class as needed. Overrides must have very strong rationale.
