# This script will be run bazel when building process starts to
# generate key-value information that represents the status of the
# workspace. The output should be like
#
# KEY1 VALUE1
# KEY2 VALUE2
#
# If the script exits with non-zero code, it's considered as a failure
# and the output will be discarded.
#
# Note that keys starting with "STABLE_" are part of the stable set, which if
# changed, invalidate any stampted targets. Keys which do not start with
# "STABLE_" are part of the volatile set, which will be used but do not
# invalidate stamped targets.

# If we're in a CoG workspace, Git operations are not supported.
# TODO: https://pwbug.dev/381305105 - This may be supported some day.
