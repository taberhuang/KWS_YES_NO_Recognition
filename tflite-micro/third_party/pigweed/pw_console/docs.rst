The Pigweed Console provides a Python repl (read eval print loop) using
`ptpython`_ and a log message viewer in a single-window terminal based
interface. It is designed to be a replacement for `IPython's embed()`_ function.

Features
--------

``pw_console`` aims to be a complete solution for interacting with hardware
devices using :ref:`module-pw_rpc` over a :ref:`module-pw_hdlc` transport.

- Interactive Python repl and log viewer in a single terminal window. This
  provides interactive RPC sending while the log viewer provides immediate
  feedback on device status.

- Easily embeddable within a project's own custom console. This should allow
  users to define their own transport layer.

- Log viewer with searching and filtering.
