# The target Arm processor.
#
# The values of this constraint_setting correspond to valid values of the -mcpu
# compiler flag. See
# https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/ARM-Options.html#index-mcpu-2. These
# values are intended to be used in `target_compatible_with` attributes of
# toolchains which specify the corresponding value of -mcpu.
#
# The constraint_values are not currently exhaustively enumerated (only a few
# of the legal -mcpu values have corresponding constraint_values). The intent
# is for additional values to be added when needed.
#
# The intent is to support only the base processor type, not -march
# values (e.g., armv7e-m). This is because it is recommended to use (processor
# type + optional architectural extensions) when configuring Arm GCC (see
# https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/tools-software-ides-blog/posts/compiler-flags-across-architectures-march-mtune-and-mcpu).
# In addition, the march values can already be captured using @platforms//cpu.
#
# Additionally, extensions should be represented via separate constraints to
# prevent the explosion of many variants.
