    Although aspect_bazel_libs includes a copy_to_bin but we cannot use
    it for now since some downstream projects don't use bzlmods and don't
    load aspect libs at all. Until then, we keep a local copy of this here.
    We only need copy_to_bin due to unusual limitations of rules_js and Node,
    see https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/blob/main/docs/README.md#javascript
