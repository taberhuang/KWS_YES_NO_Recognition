   :name: pw_build

Pigweed's modules aim to be easy to integrate into both new and existing
embedded projects. To that end, the ``pw_build`` module provides support for
multiple build systems, including:

* :ref:`Bazel <module-pw_build-bazel>` (Pigweed's
  :ref:`primary build system <seed-0111>`)
* :ref:`GN/Ninja <module-pw_build-gn>`
* :ref:`CMake <module-pw_build-cmake>`
