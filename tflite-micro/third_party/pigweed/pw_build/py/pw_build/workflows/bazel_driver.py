"""Bazel driver for workflows.

This tool converts an incoming Bazel BuildDriverRequest as ProtoJSON
into a BuildDriverResponse that contains a sequence of actions that make up
a bazel build.

Example:

$ bazel run //pw_build/py:bazel_build_driver -- \
    --request=$PWD/pw_build/test_data/bazel_build_driver_request.json
