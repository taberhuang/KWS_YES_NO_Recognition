    """A class that helps manage runtime file resources.

    Projects that use bootstrap get their files from the currently
    activated environment. In contrast, Bazel-based projects will get their
    files from Bazel's runfiles mechanism.

    This class bridges those differences, and simplifies the process of
    writing tools that work in both environments. Every resource is associated
    with a key used to retrieve the resource, and the resources must be
    registered twice: once for Bazel-based projects, and once for other
    projects that run from a shell environment bootstrapped by pw_env_setup.
    To ensure consistency, if a resource is used by one environment, an error
    will be emitted if it was never registered for the other environment.

    If a file is exclusive to one of the two environments, it may be tagged
    as ``exclusive=True`` to suppress the error emitted if a resource isn't
    properly registered for the other environment. Attempting to access a
    resource ``exclusive`` to a different environment will still raise an error.

    This class is also a :py:class:`pw_cli.tool_runner.ToolRunner`, and may be
    used to launch subprocess actions.
