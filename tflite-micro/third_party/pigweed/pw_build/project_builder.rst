Project Builder

   :name: pw_build

The ``pw_build`` Python module contains a light-weight build command execution
library used for projects that require running multiple commands to perform a
build. For example: running ``cmake`` alongside ``gn``.

Get Started
-----------
The quickest way to get started with Project Builder is to create a build script
based on existing examples.

Example Build Scripts
=====================
Examples of Project Builder based ``pw build`` commands:

- `Upstream Pigweed repo main.py <https://cs.opensource.google/pigweed/pigweed/+/main:pw_build/py/pw_build/main.py>`_
- `Examples repo build_project.py <https://cs.opensource.google/pigweed/examples/+/main:tools/sample_project_tools/build_project.py>`_
- `Kudzu repo build_project.py <https://pigweed.googlesource.com/pigweed/kudzu/+/refs/heads/main/tools/kudzu_tools/build_project.py>`_


.. _module-pw_build-project_builder-reference:

---------
Reference
---------
At a high level:

- A single :py:class:`BuildRecipe <pw_build.build_recipe.BuildRecipe>`
  contains many :py:class:`BuildCommands <pw_build.build_recipe.BuildCommand>`
  which are run sequentially.
- Multiple :py:class:`BuildRecipes <pw_build.build_recipe.BuildRecipe>` can be
  created and passed into the
  :py:class:`ProjectBuilder <pw_build.project_builder.ProjectBuilder>` class which
  provides logging and terminal output options.
- A :py:class:`ProjectBuilder <pw_build.project_builder.ProjectBuilder>` instance is
  then passed to the :py:func:`run_builds <pw_build.project_builder.run_builds>`
  function which allows specifying the number of parallel workers (the number of
  recipes which are executed in parallel).

Upstream ``pw build`` Command-Line Interface Usage
--------------------------------------------------
.. argparse::
   :module: pigweed_upstream_build.main
   :func: _build_argument_parser
   :prog: pw build

   This is the command line interface provided by the ``pw build`` command
   (`main.py
   <https://cs.opensource.google/pigweed/pigweed/+/main:pw_build/py/pigweed_upstream_build/main.py>`_)
   in upstream Pigweed.
