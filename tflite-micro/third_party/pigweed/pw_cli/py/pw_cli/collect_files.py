    """Collects files given a variety of pathspecs and maps them to their repo.

    This is a relatively fuzzy file finder for projects tracked in a Git repo.
    It's designed to adhere to the following constraints:

      * If a pathspec is a real file, unconditionally return it.
      * If no pathspecs are passed, collect from the current working directory.
      * Return the path of any files modified since `modified_since_git_ref`
        (which may be a branch, tag, or commit) that match the provided
        pathspecs.
      * Passing no pathspecs has the same behavior as passing `.` (everything in
        the current directory).

    Args:
        pathspecs: Files or git pathspecs to collect files from. Wildcards (e.g.
            `pw_cl*`) are accepted.
        tool_runner: The ToolRunner to use for Git operations.
        modified_since_git_ref: If the passed pathspec is tracked by a git repo,
            it is excluded if unmodified since the specified pathspec. If the
            pathspec is `None`, no files are excluded.
        exclude_patterns: A collection of exclude patterns to exclude from the
            set of collected files.
        action_flavor_text: Replaces "Collecting" in the
            "Collecting all files in the foo repo" log message with a
            personalized string (e.g. "Formatting all files...").

    Returns:
        A dictionary mapping a GitRepo to a list of paths relative to that
        repo's root that match the provided pathspecs. Files not tracked by
        any git repo are mapped to the `None` key.
