// The size of the stack-allocated argument encoding buffer to use by default.
// A buffer of this size is allocated and used for the 4-byte token and for
// encoding all arguments. It must be at least large enough for the token (4
// bytes).
//
// This buffer does not need to be large to accommodate a good number of
// tokenized string arguments. Integer arguments are usually encoded smaller
// than their native size (e.g. 1 or 2 bytes for smaller numbers). All floating
// point types are encoded as four bytes. Null-terminated strings are encoded
// 1:1 in size, however, and can quickly fill up this buffer.
