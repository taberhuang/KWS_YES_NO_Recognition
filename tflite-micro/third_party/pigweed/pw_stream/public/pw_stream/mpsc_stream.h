/// @file
/// This file defines types related to a multi-producer, single-consumer stream.
///
/// The single readers must be constructed in place, while writers can be moved.
/// A reader and writer may be connected using `CreateMpscStream()`. Additional
/// writers may be connected by copying a previously connected writer.
///
/// Example:
///
/// @code{.cpp}
///    ...
///    MpscReader reader;
///    MpscWriter writer;
///    CreateMpscStream(reader, writer);
///    pw::Thread t(MakeThreadOptions(), [&writer] {
///        Status status = writer.Write(GenerateSomeData());
///        ...
///    });
///    std::byte buffer[kBufSize];
///    if (auto status = reader.Read(ByteSpan(buffer)); status.ok()) {
///      ProcessSomeData(buffer);
///    }
/// @endcode
///
/// See the `MpscReader::ReadAll()` for additional examples.
///
/// The types in the files are designed to be used across different threads,
/// but are not completely thread-safe. Data must only be written by an
/// MpscWriter using a single thread, and data must only be read by an
/// MpscReader using a single thread. In other words, multiple calls to
/// `Write()` must not be made concurrently, and multiple calls to `Read()` and
/// `ReadAll()` must not be made concurrently. Calls to other methods, e.g.
/// `Close()`, are thread-safe and may be made from any thread.
