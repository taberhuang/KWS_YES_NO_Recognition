/// A task which may complete one or more asynchronous operations.
///
/// The ``Task`` interface is commonly implemented by users wishing to schedule
/// work on an  asynchronous ``Dispatcher``. To do this, users may subclass
/// ``Task``, providing an implementation of the ``DoPend`` method which
/// advances the state of the ``Task`` as far as possible before yielding back
/// to the ``Dispatcher``.
///
/// This process works similarly to cooperatively-scheduled green threads or
/// coroutines, with a ``Task`` representing a single logical "thread" of
/// execution. Unlike some green thread or coroutine implementations, ``Task``
/// does not imply a separately-allocated stack: ``Task`` state is most
/// commonly stored in fields of the ``Task`` subclass.
///
/// Once defined by a user, ``Task`` s may be run by passing them to a
/// ``Dispatcher`` via ``Dispatcher::Post``. The ``Dispatcher`` will then
/// ``Pend`` the ``Task`` every time that the ``Task`` indicates it is able
/// to make progress.
///
/// Note that ``Task`` objects *must not* be destroyed while they are actively
/// being ``Pend``'d by a ``Dispatcher``. To protect against this, be sure to
/// do one of the following:
///
/// - Use dynamic lifetimes by creating ``Task`` objects that continue to live
///   until they receive a ``DoDestroy`` call.
/// - Create ``Task`` objects whose stack-based lifetimes outlive their
///   associated ``Dispatcher``.
/// - Call ``Deregister`` on the ``Task`` prior to its destruction. NOTE that
///   ``Deregister`` may not be called from inside the ``Task``'s own ``Pend``
///   method.
