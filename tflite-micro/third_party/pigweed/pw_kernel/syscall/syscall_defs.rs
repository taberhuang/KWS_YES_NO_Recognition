//! # pw_kernel User Space API
//!
//! ## Core Concepts
//!
//! ### Objects
//! Objects are the basic building block of functionality exposed to user space.
//! They are polymorphic and may be one of a limited set of types:
//!
//! - [Channel](#channel)
//! - [Wait Group](#wait-group)
//!
//! ### Handles
//! All system calls reference objects through a u32 handle which indexes into
//! a process-local handle table.
//!
//! ### Signals and Waiting
//! Every kernel object has a set of signals that can be pending and waited
//! upon.  The exact meaning and semantics of each signal vary between kernel
//! objects.  The signal types are:
//! - [`SIGNAL_READABLE`]: Object is readable.
//! - [`SIGNAL_WRITABLE`]: Object is writable.
//! - [`SIGNAL_ERROR`]: Object is in an error state.
//! - [`SIGNAL_USER`]: User defined signal.  Useful for out of band signaling
//!   between peers on a [Channel](#channel).
//!
//! Any kernel object can be waited for signals to assert using the
//! [`object_wait()`] syscall.  Multiple objects can be waited on simultaneously
//! using a [Wait Group](#wait-group) object.
//!
//! #### Open Questions
//! - What are the multi-threaded semantics of waiting.
//!
//! ### Object and Handle Creation
//! Initially only statically defined and allocated objects and handles are
//! supported.  The creation of these will be driven through build time
//! configuration and the necessary code will be generated to allocate kernel
//! data structures as well as expose handle definitions to user space
//! processes.
//!
//! ## Object Types
//!
//! ### Channel
//! A channel is a unidirectional connection between two asymmetric peers: an
//! initiator and a handler.  A channel allows the initiator peer to send a
//! buffer of data to the handler peer and wait for it's response.  A channel
//! can have a maximum of one transaction pending at a time and is designed to
//! not require intermediate kernel buffers.
//!
//! Both a synchronous and asynchronous API is offered to the initiator
//! while the handler side API is strictly non-blocking.  All data copies
//! between peers happen during the system call.
//!
//! The flow of a transaction is as follows:
//! - The initiator starts the transaction by providing send and receive
//!   buffers to one of the two transact system calls ([`channel_transact()`] or
//!   [`channel_async_transact()`]). This has the additional side effect of
//!   clearing [`SIGNAL_READABLE`] and [`SIGNAL_WRITABLE`] on the initiator.
//! - The handler's [`SIGNAL_READABLE`] will become asserted.
//! - The handler can now read the message in multiple calls to
//!   [`channel_read()`] causing the kernel to copy the data from the
//!   initiator's send buffer to the buffer provided to [`channel_read()`].
//! - The handler completes the transaction by calling [`channel_respond()`]
//!   and providing a response.  The kernel will immediately copy the response
//!   from the handler's buffer to the initiator's receive buffer.
//!   There is no built in mechanism for the handler to signal an error
//!   to the initiator.  This is left to the higher level protocol used to
//!   communicate over the channel.  This will clear [`SIGNAL_READABLE`] and
//!   [`SIGNAL_WRITABLE`] on the handler and raise [`SIGNAL_READABLE`] on
//!   the initiator.
//!
//! The handler's only ways of communicating with the initiator are by
//! - responding to an initiated transaction
//! - raising [`SIGNAL_USER`] on the initiator by calling
//!   [`object_raise_peer_user_signal()`]
//!
//! #### Initiator Signals
//! - [`SIGNAL_WRITABLE`] indicates there is no pending transaction and one
//!   can be started. Cleared on transaction initiation.
//! - [`SIGNAL_READABLE`] indicates the handler has responded to the
//!   pending transaction.  Cleared on transaction initiation.
//! - [`SIGNAL_ERROR`] indicates pending transaction has an error.  Cleared
//!   when the initiator is waited on.
//! - [`SIGNAL_USER`] indicates the handler calls [`object_raise_peer_user_signal()`].
//!   Cleared when the initiator is waited on.
//!
//! #### Handler Signals
//! - [`SIGNAL_READABLE`] indicates there is a pending transaction.  Cleared when
//!   the handler calls [`channel_respond()`].
//! - [`SIGNAL_WRITABLE`] indicates there is a pending transaction.  Cleared when
//!   the handler calls [`channel_respond()`].
//! - [`SIGNAL_ERROR`] indicates a pending transaction error.  No error states
//!   are defined at the moment.  In the future an error may be raised when
//!   the remote peer closes.
//! - [`SIGNAL_USER`] indicates the initiator calls [`object_raise_peer_user_signal()`].
//!   Cleared when the initiator is waited on.
//!
//! ### Wait Group
//! Wait groups provide a mechanism for waiting on multiple handles at once.
//! Handles can be added to and removed from a wait group with [`wait_group_add()`]
//! and [`wait_group_remove()`].  In addition to a set of signals to wait on,
//! an arbitrary `user_data` is provided to [`wait_group_add()`].  This value
//! is returned by [`object_wait()`], unmodified by the kernel, when the wait group is
//! waited on.
//!
//! #### Open questions:
//! - How is the wait group's member list allocated in there kernel.  To support
//!   a fully statically allocated kernel one of two approaches are being
//!   considered:
//!   - an object (or possibly handle) may only be in a single wait group at
//!     one time.  This allows a wait group to maintain an intrusive list of
//!     objects with the list element storage being stored in the object.
//!   - wait queues are statically sized at compile time and adding more objects
//!     than there is space for will return an error.
//!
//! ### Interrupt
//! In design
//!
//! ### Futex
//! In design
//!
//! ## System Calls
//! The C ABI system calls listed here are not intended to be called directly
//! by user space code and instead be accessed through language idiomatic
//! wrapper libraries.
//!
//! ### Generic Syscalls
//! - [`object_wait()`]
//! - [`object_raise_peer_user_signal()`]
//!
//! ### Channel Initiator Syscalls
//! - [`channel_transact()`]
//! - [`channel_async_transact()`]
//! - [`channel_async_cancel()`]
//!
//! ### Channel Handler Syscalls
//! - [`channel_read()`]
//! - [`channel_respond()`]
//!
//! ### Wait Group Syscalls
//! - [`wait_group_add()`]
//! - [`wait_group_remove()`]
