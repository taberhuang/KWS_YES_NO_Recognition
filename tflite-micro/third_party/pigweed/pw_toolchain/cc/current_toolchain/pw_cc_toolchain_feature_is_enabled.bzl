This rule is a bridge that allows feature presence/absence to be communicated
from a toolchain configuration as if it was just a `bool_flag`.

This allows toolchain features to become branches in `select()` statements:

```py
_cc_toolchain_feature_is_enabled(
    name = "toolchain_flavor_chocolate",
    feature_name = "toolchain_flavor_chocolate",
)

config_setting(
    name = "chocolate",
    flag_values = {":toolchain_flavor_chocolate": "True"},
)

cc_library(
    name = "libfoo",
    copts = select({
        ":chocolate": ["-fno-dog-food"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
    srcs = ["foo.cc"],
)
```
