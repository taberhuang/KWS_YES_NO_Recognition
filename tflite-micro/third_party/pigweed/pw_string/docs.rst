   - **Efficient**: No memory allocation, no pointer indirection.
   - **Easy**: Use the string API you already know.
   - **Safe**: Never worry about buffer overruns or undefined behavior.

   *Pick three!* If you know how to use ``std::string``, just use
   :cpp:type:`pw::InlineString` in the same way:

   .. Note for docs maintainers: the next code example could be built
   .. but is difficult to test because it generates a runtime crash.

   .. code-block:: cpp

      // Create a string from a C-style char array; storage is pre-allocated!
      pw::InlineString<16> my_string = "Literally";

      // We have some space left, so let's add to the string.
      my_string.append('?', 3);  // "Literally???"

      // Let's try something evil and extend this past its capacity ðŸ˜ˆ
      my_string.append('!', 8);
      // Foiled by a crash! No mysterious bugs or undefined behavior.

   Need to build up a string? :cpp:type:`pw::StringBuilder` works like
   ``std::ostringstream``, but with most of the efficiency and memory benefits
   of :cpp:type:`pw::InlineString`:

String manipulation on embedded systems can be surprisingly challenging.

- **C strings?** They're light-weight but come with many pitfalls for those who
  don't know the standard library deeply.

- **C++ strings?** STL string classes are safe and easy to use, but they consume
  way too much code space and are designed to be used with dynamic memory
  allocation.

- **Roll your own strings?** You don't have time! You have a product to ship!

Embedded systems need string functionality that is both *safe* and *suitable*
for resource-constrained platforms.

.. rst-class:: key-text

   ``pw_string`` provides safe string handling functionality with an API that
   closely matches that of ``std::string``, but without dynamic memory
   allocation and with a *much* smaller :ref:`binary size impact<module-pw_string-size-reports>`.

--------------------
Is it right for you?
--------------------
.. rst-class:: key-text

   ``pw_string`` is useful any time you need to handle strings in embedded C++.

If your project written in C, ``pw_string`` is not a good fit since we don't
currently expose a C API.

On the other hand, for larger platforms where code space isn't in short supply
and dynamic memory allocation isn't a problem, you may find that ``std::string``
meets your needs.

.. tip::
   ``pw_string`` works just as well on larger embedded platforms and host
   systems. Using ``pw_string`` even when you could get away with ``std:string``
   gives you the flexibility to move to smaller platforms later with much less
   rework.
