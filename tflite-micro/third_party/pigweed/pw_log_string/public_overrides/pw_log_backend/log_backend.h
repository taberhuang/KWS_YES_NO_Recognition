#include "pw_log_string/handler.h"

// Log a message with many attributes included. This is a backend implementation
// for the logging facade in pw_log/log.h.
//
// This is the log macro frontend that funnels everything into the C-based
// message hangler facade, i.e. pw_log_string_HandleMessage. It's not efficient
// at the callsite, since it passes many arguments.
//
// Users can configure exactly what is passed to pw_log_string_HandleMessage by
// providing their own PW_LOG_STRING_HANDLE_MESSAGE implementation.
